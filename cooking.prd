8) Sample content seeds for prototype

8.1 Carbon Steel (1 sample)
	•	Title: Food sticking after seasoning on carbon steel: causes and fixes
	•	Direct Answer: If food sticks after seasoning, the most common cause is excess oil that never polymerized. Heat the pan to light smoke, wipe to a thin sheen, and bake on 3 thin coats until a dry, hard film forms. Test by sliding an egg and checking for tackiness.
	•	Key Table row: Symptom=Sticking, Cause=Insufficient polymerization, Fix steps=Preheat 2 min, wipe to sheen, heat to light smoke 3–4 min, cool, repeat 3x, Heat=Medium‑high to first smoke, Test outcome=Egg slides cleanly.

8.2 High‑Protein (1 sample)
	•	Title: 30 g protein cottage‑egg scramble in 8 minutes
	•	Direct Answer: This scramble delivers about 30 g protein in 8 minutes with a low GL. Use 2 eggs, 150 g low‑fat cottage cheese, and 60 g chopped spinach. Cook until curds set, then rest 1 minute before serving.
	•	Key Table row: Recipe=Scramble, Time=8, Protein=30, Carbs=6, Fat=12, GL=Low, Make‑ahead=No.

8.3 Salsiccia (1 sample)
	•	Title: Rigatoni salsiccia bianco with ricotta, 18 minutes
	•	Direct Answer: Brown salsiccia, deglaze with a splash of pasta water, then add ricotta and emulsify off heat. Toss with rigatoni, finish with lemon zest. Total time is about 18 minutes.
	•	Key Table row: Variant=Bianco ricotta, Pan order=Brown, deglaze, emulsify, toss, Deglaze=None, Liquid=Pasta water, Cheese=Ricotta, Timing=18, Notes=Zest and black pepper to finish.

8.4 Air Fryer (1 sample)
	•	Title: Chicken thighs 600–700 g in air fryer: 200 °C for 18–22 min, 74 °C doneness
	•	Direct Answer: For 600–700 g bone‑in thighs, cook at 200 °C for 18–22 minutes, flip at 12 minutes, and rest 3 minutes. Check an internal temp of 74 °C at the thickest part.
	•	Key Table row: Item=Chicken thighs, Cut=Bone‑in, Weight=600–700 g, Temp=200 °C, Time=18–22, Prep=Dry, Flip?=Yes, Rest=3, Doneness=74 °C.
